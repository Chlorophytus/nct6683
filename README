Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Nuvoton NCT6683D eSIO chip.

The chips implement up to shared 32 temperature and voltage sensors.
It supports up to 16 fan rotation sensors and up to 8 fan control engines.

Temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius. Measurement resolution is
0.5 degrees C.

Voltage sensors (also known as IN sensors) report their values in millivolts.

Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute).

Note
----

Limit register locations on Intel DH87RL with EC firmware version 1.0 build
date 04/03/13 do not match the register locations in the datasheet and thus
display all 0. Correct register locations are currently unknown.
