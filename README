Note
====

Substantial testing and review feedback will be required for this driver to be
merged into the upstream kernel. If you use the latest version of this driver,
and/or if you can provide review feedback, please let the author know.
Please report the board as well as the firmware version (the firmware version
is displayed in the boot log when the driver loads).

Also see Usage Note below for additional information about firmware variants.

Kernel driver nct6683
=====================

Supported chips:
  * Nuvoton NCT6683D
    Prefix: 'nct6683'
    Addresses scanned: ISA address retrieved from Super I/O registers
    Datasheet: Available from Nuvoton upon request

Authors:

Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Nuvoton NCT6683D eSIO chip.

The chips implement up to shared 32 temperature and voltage sensors.
It supports up to 16 fan rotation sensors and up to 8 fan control engines.

Temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius. Measurement resolution is
0.5 degrees C.

Voltage sensors (also known as IN sensors) report their values in millivolts.

Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute).

Usage Note
----------

Limit register locations on Intel DH87RL with EC firmware version 1.0 build
date 04/03/13 do not match the register locations in the datasheet.
Nuvoton confirms that Intel uses a special firmware version with different
register addresses. A datasheet for the Intel firmware is not available.

Some of the register locations can be reverse engineered; others are too
well hidden. Given this, writing any values from the operating system is
considered too risky and has been disabled. All limits must all be written
from the BIOS.

The driver has been tested with the Intel firmware only.
